Bomberman
=========

Develop
-------

This repository is dedicated to a future web based game inspired by Bomberman.

This project is currently at the design stage and we are still heavily discussing the basic aspects of the game like:
* The view
  * A top down 2D view
  * A first person 3D view
* The technology used
* And many more!

Concerning the Git structure, we will follow the one given by https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/images/a/a2/Git_flow_-_diagram.png, thank you for sticking to it if you want to work on this project.


###Ideas
* Classic mode
* "Commando" mode where players hit by a bomb are frozen and all players of one team need to be frozen in order for the other team to win. Players can unfreeze frozen allied players.
 * Closed view maps
 * First person view
* "RPG" mode where players have to chose their iventory (bombs/items) before the start of the game
